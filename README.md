# Bank-Loan-Report
**Overview**
This project evaluates bank loan performance by leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. The objective is to provide data-driven insights into loan trends, repayment behavior, and key financial metrics across various segments.

**Objectives**

**Summarize Key Metrics:**

-Total Loan Applications
-Total Funded Amount
-Total Amount Received
-Average Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

**Analyze Loan Status:**

-Good Loans: Fully Paid or Current
-Bad Loans: Charged Off
-Monthly trends and percentages of good vs. bad loans

**Segment Analysis:**

-Loan Terms (e.g., 36, 60 months)
-Purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement)
-Home Ownership Status (e.g., homeowner, renter)
-Geographic Distribution (State-wise analysis)

**Methodology**

**Data Analysis:**
-SQL was used to compute key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of loan applications, funded amounts, repayment collections, and segmentation by status.

**Data Visualization:**
-Power BI dashboards were created to present interactive insights, allowing stakeholders to track performance and filter data dynamically.

**Key Findings**
-Good Loan Ratio: 86.2% of total loans were categorized as good loans.
-Total Funded Amount: $435.8M with a month-over-month increase of 13%.
-Average Interest Rate: 12.0%, with minor fluctuations month-to-month.
-Top Loan Purposes: Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing accounted for the highest funded amounts.

**Tools & Technologies**

**SQL**: Data querying, KPI computation, and performance analysis

**Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling

**Conclusion**
This project highlights the combined power of SQL and Power BI in delivering actionable insights for financial decision-making. The comprehensive analysis provides a solid foundation for optimizing loan portfolios and improving financial outcomes.
